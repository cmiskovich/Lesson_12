## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
*Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. You want to use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes.  You will use a dataset of historical lending activity from peer to peer lending servies to build a model that can identify the credit worthiness of borrowers.

* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
This project used the file lending_data.csv to predict credit worthiness based on several attributes.

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
We checked the balance of variable "y" based on the value_counts function.
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
The stages were at first using a regression model with the orignina data.  Then using a Resression Model with resampled training data we then used a RandomOverSampler module to have the model better perform.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).
The methods performed were a train test split and then fitting the model and then predicting the model.  After than we performed a RandomOverSamper model to have the denied loans have the same weight as the healthy loans.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  *This model is using real data and spliting it into test and training data.  The precision for healthy loans was 100% and recall wall was 99% a strong model for predicting healthy loans.  The risk loans were 85% precision and 91% recall still a strong model but not as strong as the healthy loan model.  Accuracy was 90.24% for this model.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * After over sampling the high risk loans the precision was 84% for high risk loans but recall increased to 99%.  The precision and recall was the same for healthy loans. Accuracy was 99.36 for this model.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* I'm going with the over sampled machine learning model 2 due to the fact the accuracy increased and the recall increased for risky loans.

* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
* Both because the 0's over time will make you money off of interest payments and are a larger sample, however if high risk loans get approved at a lower interest rate they may default and lose the entire investment.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
